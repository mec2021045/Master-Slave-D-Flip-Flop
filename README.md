## Static timing Analysis and design of Master-Slave D flip flop in LT-spice using PTM 180 nm CMOS Technology
### Computed setup and hold time of the circuit can work and maximum operating frequency at which the circuit can work and then understood the concept of setup and hold time violation and methods to remove it
